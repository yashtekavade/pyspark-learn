# PySpark Learn - Repository Structure

This repository is organized to help you learn PySpark in a structured, topic-wise manner. Each folder covers a key aspect of PySpark, with examples and explanations.

## Structure

1. **01_spark_architecture**
	- Spark architecture concepts, cluster overview, execution flow, DAG, etc.
2. **02_etl_basics**
	- PySpark code for ETL/data engineering basics: reading/writing data, schema, DataFrame operations.
3. **03_transformations**
	- Each transformation (map, filter, join, etc.) with code examples and explanations.
4. **04_functions**
	- Common PySpark functions (UDFs, built-in functions, etc.) with usage examples.
5. **05_aggregations**
	- Aggregation operations (groupBy, agg, pivot, etc.) with code samples.
6. **06_structured_streaming**
	- Structured Streaming basics, examples, and use cases.
7. **07_performance_optimization**
	- Tips and techniques for optimizing PySpark jobs (caching, partitioning, broadcast joins, etc.).
8. **08_practice_projects**
	- End-to-end mini projects for hands-on practice.

## How to Use
- Start from `01_spark_architecture` for fundamentals.
- Progress through each folder for deeper understanding and hands-on coding.
- Use `08_practice_projects` to apply your learning.

Feel free to add notes, code, and examples in each folder as you learn.
